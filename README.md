I also used various images found on the WikiMedia commons. The vast majority, if not all, belong to the public domain. You can find these images in the source `index.html`.

## Construction notes

The presentation had to look good on exactly one display (mine) and work for exactly one event (the presentation). So I used a lot of hardcoded values and never learned a better way. I imagine there's much room to style the presentation more artfully but it's too late for all that. If you have useful suggestions or constructive complaints, please make an issue.

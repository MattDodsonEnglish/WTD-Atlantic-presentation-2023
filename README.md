# My presentation for WTD Atlantic 2023

This repo holds my [RevealJS](https://revealjs) slides for my presentation at [Write The Docs Atlantic](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2023/).

All the code and CSS files were developed as part of RevealJS. They thus retain the RevealJS MIT license.

The presentation itself, including the images, text, video, and audio, is licensed under a Creative Commons by 4.0.
Almost all of the media in the `static` dir is original, except the Milquetoast cartoon.

Other images were repurposed. The vast majority, if not all, belong to the public domain. You can find these images in the source `index.html`.

I know there are better ways to style the presentation but it's too late for all that. If you have useful suggestions or constructive complaints, please make an issue.

This repo holds the [RevealJS](https://revealjs.com) source code for my presentation at [Write The Docs Atlantic](https://www.writethedocs.org/conf/atlantic/2023/).

## License

All the code and CSS files are forked from RevealJS. They retain the RevealJS MIT license.

The presentation itself, including the images, text, video, and audio, is licensed under a Creative Commons by 4.0.
All media in the `static` dir is original or public domain&mdash;except the Milquetoast cartoon and the wizard gif.

I also used various images found on the WikiMedia commons. The vast majority, if not all, belong to the public domain. You can find these images in the source `index.html`.

## Construction notes

The presentation had to look good on exactly one display (mine) and work for exactly one event (the presentation). So I used a lot of hardcoded values and never learned a better way. I imagine there's much room to style the presentation more artfully but it's too late for all that. If you have useful suggestions or constructive complaints, please make an issue.
